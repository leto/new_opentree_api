# Version Control Strategy for OpenTree

This document describes the requirements and justifications for the each
architectural decision that has been made regarding Version Control. It will be
a living document that changes as the community, data and technology of
OpenTree changes.

# Data repository

Currently the source data for OpenTree consists of a
collection of JSON files (which are in the NexSON
format) which live in the [treenexus](https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/treenexus) Github repo.
There is also a [treenexus_test](https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/treenexus_test) repo to use
in testing, since the treenexus repo is quite large.

NOTE: The name "treenexus" will be deprecated soon and changed to something
less confusing, since the repo does not contain files in the NEXUS format.

# Code repository

The code implementing the OpenTree API lives on [Github](https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/api.opentreeoflife.org/)

# WIP branches

When a change to NexSON data is submitted via the OpenTree API, it is made on
what we refer to as a "WIP (work in progress) branch", which has a name of the form
"USERNAME_study_N" where USERNAME is a github username and N is the study ID.

If the same user makes multiple edits to a single study, they will appear as
multiple commits on that WIP branch. If that user makes edits to another study
M, they will go onto the branch "USERNAME_study_M".

This allows multiple curators to work on the same study without stepping on
each others toes during the curation process. There is still the possibilty
that curators will make incompatible changes, which means the first one to
merge their WIP branch will merge cleanly, but when the second curator branch
is attempted to be merged, conflicts could arise if the curators edited the
same parts of the NexSON.

# Merging WIP branches

The API has the ability to merge WIP branches. If the branch can be successfully
merged with no conflicts, the branch will be removed both locally (on the deployed
server) and remotely (on Github). If the same curator starts editing the same study
later on, a new branch of the same name will be created from the tip of the latest
commit on the master branch at that time.
